# BTD5-Decomp
A decompilation of Ninja Kiwi's game [Bloons TD 5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/306020/Bloons_TD_5/).

## How?
This decompilation is made by hand. The names of files, classes, etc are either made up arbitrarily, or discovered with the help of left-over debug info.

## Is this a 1:1 complete copy of the game or source code?
That is the goal, however since we do not have access to the source code, we cannot know for sure. What we can know, is if the compiled code from this decomp matches the compiled code of the game.

## How do I build this?
Right now you can't. In the future, however, chances are you will be able to build an exe by disassembling the game's exe, and then transplanting the code generated by this project into it. That will likely be the way to do things until it becomes a fully complete decompilation (which, realistically speaking, may never be possible).

## Can this be used for mods?
Yes, absolutely! I suggest looking at the NKHook5 project that will soon be reliant on this project for most patching and such. It will also help avoid copyright/dmca problems, as making a mod directly into the game's exe would mean you would have to make pirated copies to distribute the mod (very illegal!!).
